            Hey Babe, you’re finally almost at the end of another year, and today, you’re getting one year older. I’ve made a digital cake for you—so let’s cut it! I feel so blessed to see you grow every day and as the years pass, for being exactly who you are. ❤ You are the only person I rely on, my human diary, and my best friend. I want to thank you for the endless things you do for me, even if you don’t realize it. 🫂 I genuinely believe you are an amazing person 💎—thank you for being my person. I promise that I will always love you for who you are, accept you with your flaws, and stand by you. ❤  
Not gonna make this too long, but wherever the year ahead takes you, I hope it’s a happy one. 🧿 And if it’s not, I know you’ll make it a good one 🤞because you’re strong enough to rise above any obstacle. 🫂 May Allah grant you all your heart’s wishes and the ability to cherish the abundance of blessings in your life. ❤  
Wishing you a very Happy Birthday! ❤🎂
