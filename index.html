I promise that I will always love you for who you are, accept you with your flaws, and stand by you. ❤ Not gonna make this too long, but wherever the year ahead takes you, I hope it’s a happy one. 🧿 And if it’s not, I know you’ll make it a good one 🤞because you’re strong enough to rise above any obstacle. 🫂 May Allah grant you all your heart’s wishes and the ability to cherish the abundance of blessings in your life. ❤ Wishing you a very Happy Birthday! ❤🎂</p>
